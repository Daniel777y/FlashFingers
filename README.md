# FlashFingers
FlashFingers is a typing game based on React, whose goals are to help players improve their typing speed and memorize words or paragraphs.

## Business Requirement

### Nouns & Verbs

I will highlight **nouns in bold**, and *verbs in italics*.

* **Players** are *given* **random paragraphs** and *type* them as accurately and quickly as possible.
* Players will get **immediate feedbacks** like **colors** and **sounds** while typing.
* FlashFingers will *record* the **time** and thus *calculate* the **speed (words per minute, wpm)**.
* During the game, Players can see a *progress bar* based on their average speed.
* FlashFingers can also calculate **accuracy** based on the number of times they *enter* **incorrect characters**.
* Players can *browse* their **game history**, and *replay* a specific paragraph.
* Players can *upload* their own **texts and word sets** to the game.
* FlashFingers will *offer* different **fonts** for players.

### Target audience

People who want to learn typing, increase typing speed, and improve the literacy skills of a new language.

### Rules

* All the data are stored in local storage.
* In a game, the length of text is no more than 100 words (no more than 1000 characters).
* If a game is interrupted, it won't be recorded.
* If the player didn't has any record (new player), the game will not display the progress bar.
* In the initial stages of development, only support English character input.
* The game stores up to 100 records.
* All fonts in the game should be open source.
* Players can mute the game.
* Players can upload their own text and word sets by inputting or uploading .json files. If they upload .json file, they are suppose to format the file, and upload a single file at a time.

### Challenge Questions

* Do the players only play on PC browsers? If so, should the interface be responsive?
* If players don't do any other actions, they just type, one paragraph by another paragraph, would the game end?
* In terms of accuracy and speed, does the game record them for each paragraph or for all the texts?
* The game will give texts randomly by default, can players sort the "laylist"at their will? (endless and myPlaylist)
* What is the maximum size of a file that players can upload?

He doesnâ€™t have the energy to dive deep into the latest skills anymore, but he thinks typing, one thing he has been doing for more than 40 years, is a good idea. **As a typing master, Usher wants to upload some literature text to FlashFingers and type them, because this way, he not only keeps typing, but he can be also able to enjoy some literary works that he had no time to read before.**

**Non-Tech & Seniors:** Linda is a 55-year-old retiree who was a gardener and has never been much interested in technology. She only uses basic cell phone and occasionally browses the internet on a desktop computer. But recently her son went to college in another state, and she wants to practice typing so that he could send emails and messages to her son. As a computer novice and a mother who misses her son, Linda wants to use FlashFingers to cultivate the typing skill, because it is a game after all that she can practice in a stress-free environment.
