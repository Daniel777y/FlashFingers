> **prompt 1:** I am creating a typing game. Specifically, I will provide paragraphs for users, and they will type those text. This game aims to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy. Users will have random paragraphs, get immediate feedbacks (colors and sounds), and can upload their own texts(paragraphs). The game can record the game histories, and will calculate the speed(wpm) and accuracy. Please describe all these features in short, and if you have other amazing ideas, feel free to show me.
